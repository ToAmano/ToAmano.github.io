	Abstract = {Chiral superconductivity, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, can exhibit a wealth of fascinating properties that are highly sought after for nanoscience applications. We identify doped graphene monolayer as a system where chiral superconductivity can be realized. In this material, a unique situation arises at a doping where the Fermi surface is nested and the density of states is singular. In this regime, d-wave superconductivity can emerge from repulsive electron--electron interactions. Using a renormalization group method, we argue that superconductivity dominates over all competing orders for generic weak repulsive interactions. Superconductivity develops simultaneously in two degenerate d-wave pairing channels. We argue that the resulting superconducting state is of chiral type, with the phase of the superconducting order parameter winding by 4πaround the Fermi surface. Realization of this state in doped graphene will prove that superconductivity can emerge from electron--electron repulsion, and will open the door to applications of chiral superconductivity.},

abstract = "The Van Hove singularity (VHS) provides a paradigm for the study of the role of peaks in the density of states (dos) on electronic properties. More importantly, it appears to play a major role in the physics of the high-Tc superconductors, particularly since recent photoemission studies have found that the VHS is close to the Fermi level in most of the high-Tc cuprates near the composition of optimum Tc. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the VHS model, describing both theoretical properties and experimental evidence for the picture. Special topics discussed include a survey of the Fermi surfaces of the cuprates and related compounds, and an analysis of the reliability of the slave boson approach to correlation effects. While many properties of the cuprates can be qualitatively understood by a simple rigid-band-filling model, this is inadequate for more quantitative results, since correlation effects tend to pin the Fermi level near the VHS over an extended doping range, and can lead to a nanoscale phase separation. Furthermore, the peaks in the dos lead to competition from other instabilities, both magnetic and structural (related to charge density waves). A novel form of dynamic structural instability, involving dynamic VHS-Jahn-Teller effects has been predicted. Scattered through the literature, there is considerable experimental evidence for both nanoscale phase separation of holes, and for local, possibly dynamic, structural disorder. This review attempts to gather these results into a comprehensive database, to sort the results, and to see how they fit into the Van Hove scenario. Recent experiments on underdoped cuprates are found to provide a strong confirmation that the pseudogap is driven by a splitting of the VHS degeneracy."

abstract = "wannier90 \UTF{00A0}is a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWFs) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWFs in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 \UTF{00A0}is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWFs can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 \UTF{00A0}is able to output MLWFs for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. We present here an updated version of wannier90, wannier90 \UTF{00A0}2.0, including minor bug fixes and parallel (MPI) execution for band-structure interpolation and the calculation of properties such as density of states, Berry curvature and orbital magnetisation. wannier90 \UTF{00A0}is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Comm. 178(2008)685 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions [2] from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled, and using these Wannier functions to calculate electronic properties of materials. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space.

    abstract = { We observe that H3S has a BCC structure and, with nearest neighbor hopping only, a strong singularity occurs at zero energy. This singularity is accompanied with a highly nested Fermi surface, which is not conducive to a stable superconducting instability. Introduction of next-nearest-neighbor hopping removes the singularity, but a “robust” peak remains in the electron density of states. Solution of the BCS equations shows an enhanced superconducting Tc due to this peak. Furthermore, nesting is no longer present, so other instabilities will not compete effectively with superconductivity. We find high critical temperatures are possible, even with very modest coupling strengths. We also examine a limit of the T = 0 equations (in an Appendix) where an analytical solution is possible over the entire range of coupling strengths, and therefore the BCS-BEC crossover is fully covered. }

Its singularities are discussed with regard to a paper of van Hove [5]. As is detailed in the paper, using the standard approximation of these functions for the calculation of thermodynamic observables proves to be justified only for very low temperatures. In order to facilitate their application for calculations in case of higher temperatures, the exact densities of states are approximated by elementary functions with a relative error of less than 1 per 1000."

    abstract = { Topological insulators and their intriguing edge states can be understood in a single-particle picture and can as such be exhaustively classified. Interactions significantly complicate this picture and can lead to entirely new insulating phases, with an altogether much richer and less explored phenomenology. Most saliently, lattice generalizations of fractional quantum Hall states, dubbed fractional Chern insulators, have recently been predicted to be stabilized by interactions within nearly dispersionless bands with nonzero Chern number, C. Contrary to their continuum analogues, these states do not require an external magnetic field and may potentially persist even at room temperature, which make these systems very attractive for possible applications such as topological quantum computation. This review recapitulates the basics of tight-binding models hosting nearly flat bands with nontrivial topology, C≠0, and summarizes the present understanding of interactions and strongly correlated phases within these bands. Emphasis is made on microscopic models, highlighting the analogy with continuum Landau level physics, as well as qualitatively new, lattice specific, aspects including Berry curvature fluctuations, competing instabilities as well as novel collective states of matter emerging in bands with |C|>1. Possible experimental realizations, including oxide interfaces and cold atom implementations as well as generalizations to flat bands characterized by other topological invariants are also discussed. }

    abstract = "{It is believed that strong ferromagnetic interactions in some solids are generated by subtle interplay between quantum many-body effects and spin-independent Coulomb interactions between electrons. It is a challenging problem to verify this scenario in the Hubbard model, which is an idealized model for strongly interacting electrons in a solid.Nagaoka's ferromagnetism is a well-known rigorous example of ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model. It deals with the limiting situation in which there is one fewer electron than in the half-filling and the on-site Coulomb interaction is infinitely large. There are relatively new rigorous examples of ferromagnetism in Hubbard models called flat-band ferromagnetism. Flat-band ferromagnetism takes place in carefully prepared models in which the lowest bands (in the single-electron spectra) are “flat.” Usually, these two approaches are regarded as two complimentary routes to ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model.In the present paper we describe Nagaoka's ferromagnetism and flat-band ferromagnetism in detail, giving all the necessary background as well as complete (but elementary) mathematical proofs. By studying an intermediate model called the long-range hopping model, we also demonstrate that there is indeed a deep relation between these two seemingly different approaches to ferromagnetism.We further discuss some attempts to go beyond these approaches. We briefly discuss recent rigorous example of ferromagnetism in the Hubbard model which has neither infinitely large parameters nor completely flat bands. We give preliminary discussion regarding possible experimental realizations of the (nearly-)flat-band ferromagnetism. Finally, we focus on some theoretical attempts to understand metallic ferromagnetism. We discuss three artificial one-dimensional models in which the existence of metallic ferromagnetism can be easily proved.We have tried to make the present paper as self-contained as possible, keeping in mind readers who are new to the field. Although the present paper is written as a review, it contains some material which appears for the first time.}",

Here we study a class of Hubbard models on decorated lattices, which have a special property that the corresponding single-electron Schr{\"o}dinger equation hasNd-fold degenerate ground states. The degeneracyNd is proportional to the total number of sites |$\Lambda$|. We prove that the ground states of the models exhibit ferromagnetism when the electron filling factor is not more than and sufficiently close to\UTF{03F1}=Nd/(2|$\Lambda$|), and paramagnetism when the filling factor is sufficiently small. An important feature of the present work is that it provides examples of three dimensional itinerant electron systems which are proved to exhibit ferromagnetism in a finite range of the electron filling factor.",

Program Title: FermiSurfer Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/36992zhpvk.1 Licensing provisions: MIT Programming language: C Nature of problem: The anisotropy of quantities on Fermi surfaces (the character of orbitals, etc.) strongly affects electronic properties, such as superconductivity or thermoelectricity, in metals. Observing the anisotropy, however, remains difficult. Thus, a graphical tool that can elucidate how quantities vary over complicated Fermi surfaces is highly desirable. Solution method: FermiSurfer uses the tetrahedron method to compute Fermi surfaces. The French-curve interpolation is used to display smooth Fermi surfaces. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features : The parallel- and cross-eye stereograms are available to enhance the visibility of complicated Fermi surfaces. This program works on any operating system, such as Linux, UNIX, macOS, and Windows, in which OpenGL library is installed."

abstract="Due to its low atomic mass, hydrogen is the most promising element to search forhigh-temperature phononic superconductors. However, metallic phases of hydrogen are onlyexpected at extreme pressures (400\UTF{00A0}GPa or higher). The measurement of the recordsuperconducting critical temperature of 203\UTF{00A0}K in a hydrogen-sulfur compound at\UTF{00A0}160\UTF{00A0}GPa ofpressure\UTF{00A0}[A.P.\UTF{00A0}Drozdov, M.I. Eremets, I.A. Troyan, arXiv:1412.0460[cond-mat.supr-con] (2014); A.P. Drozdov, M.I. Eremets, I.A. Troyan, V.Ksenofontov, S.I. Shylin, Nature 525, 73 (2015)], shows that metallization ofhydrogen can be reached at significantly lower pressure by inserting it in the matrix ofother elements. In this work we investigate the phase diagram and the superconductingproperties of the H-S systems by means of minima hopping method for structure predictionand density functional theory for superconductors. We also show that Se-H has a similarphase diagram as its sulfur counterpart as well as high superconducting criticaltemperature. We predict H3Se to exceed\UTF{00A0}120\UTF{00A0}K superconductivity at\UTF{00A0}100\UTF{00A0}GPa. We showthat both H3Se andH3S, due to thecritical temperature and peculiar electronic structure, present rather unusualsuperconducting properties.",
