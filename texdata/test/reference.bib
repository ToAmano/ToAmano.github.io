        abstract = {It is remarkable how the Fröhlich polaron, one of the simplest examples of a Quantum Field Theoretical problem, as it basically\
 consists of a single fermion interacting with a scalar Bose field of ion displacements, has resisted full analytical or numerical solution at all \
coupling since ∼1950, when its Hamiltonian was first written. The field has been a testing ground for analytical, semi-analytical and numerical tec\
hniques, such as path integrals, strong-coupling perturbation expansion, advanced variational, exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (\
QMC) techniques. This paper reviews recent developments in the field of continuum and discrete (lattice) Fröhlich (bi)polarons starting with the ba\
sics and covering a number of active directions of research.}
